        <h1>Gojo Satoru</h1>
        <p>
          Gojo Satoru is a prominent character in the popular manga and anime
          series "Jujutsu Kaisen," created by Gege Akutami. As a special-grade
          jujutsu sorcerer, he is known for his extraordinary strength,
          unmatched combat skills, and mastery of cursed techniques. Born into
          the prestigious Gojo family, Satoru inherited the Limitless Cursed
          Technique and the Six Eyes, making him one of the most powerful
          sorcerers in the jujutsu world. He serves as a teacher at Tokyo
          Metropolitan Curse Technical College, where he mentors young
          sorcerers, including the series' protagonist, Yuji Itadori. Gojo's
          charismatic and often playful demeanor masks his deep commitment to
          protecting humanity from curses and reforming the jujutsu society.
